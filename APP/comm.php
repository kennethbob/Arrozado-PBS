    <p><h1>Community Education</h1>

<h2><i>What is community education? A guide and booklist.</i></h2>

<p>Broadly, we can approach community education as 'education for community within community'. In other words, something called 'community' is not just the place or context in which education is to occur, fostering community is also a central concern. The process of becoming part of an existing social network in order to encourage dialogue and learning is sometimes labelled as informal education in UK discussions or as community education in Scottish debates. For example, CeVe (Scotland) have defined community education as:</p>

<blockquote>..a process designed to enrich the lives of individuals and groups by engaging with people living within a geographical area, or sharing a common interest, to develop voluntarily a range of learning, action and reflection opportunities, determined by their personal, social, economic and political needs. (CeVe 1990: 2)
However, this particular definition does not put 'education for community' at the centre of the work (although some practitioners may interpret it to do so) - and this dilutes the concept somewhat.</blockquote>

<p>Community education in its stronger sense has parallels in the tradition of community organization in the USA, <a id = "http" href = "http://biblio/b-socped.html">sozial pädagogik</a> in Germany, <a id = "http" href = "http://animate/b-animat.html">animation</a> in France and socio-cultural work in Belgium. Furthermore, it links up with the thinking and practice of those who have worked for community-based, and <a id = "http" href = "http://biblio/b-dem.html">democratic schooling</a> - and for child-centred education. If approached in many Southern countries, then our focus would most likely be <a id = "http" href = "http://biblio/b-nonfor.html">non-formal education</a> or <a id = "http" href = "http://b-compar.html">community participation</a>. It could be seen as close to the Latin American tradition of <a id = "http" href = "http://biblio/b-poped.html">popular education</a> or the French tradition of <a id = "http" href = "http://associative/b-assoc.html">la vie associative</a> with its emphasis on association.</p>

<p>Different practice traditions have arisen in various contexts - but there are some important points of contact and exchange. They have not grown in isolation. For example, in recent years the work of <a id = "http" href = "http://thinkers/et-freir.html">Paulo Freire</a> has been influential in each. We can also draw lines historically - for example from <a id = "http" href = "http://thinkers/et-rous.html">Rousseau</a> through key thinkers in the social pedagogy tradition to <a id = "http" href = "http://thinkers/et-dewey.html">Dewey</a> and then on through <a id = "http" href = "http://thinkers/et-lind.html">Lindeman</a> and others to <a id = "http" href = "http://b-comorg.html">community organization</a> and <a id = "http" href = "http//:hp-intro.htm"> informal education</a>. Each tradition of practice provides a way to the others - and it is perhaps most helpful to think of them as always existing in relation to one another.</p>

<h4>Further reading</h4>
<p>The listing focuses specifically on the idea of community education. I have done this avoid too much duplication with the other elements of the bibliography. This is a guide to the texts that explore and theorize community education practice rather than a comprehensive listing of all materials in the area. Questions of process, work with different groups, the impact of social division etc. are best approached through the other sections. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>informal education,</li>
<li>community development and community participation,</li>
<li>adult education, and</li>
<li>youth work</li>
</ul>
<p>I have devoted a special section to the development of community education in <a id = "http" href = "b-scotce.html">Scotland</a> where it has taken a significant organizational form.</p>
<p>We lack a full-length text that explores community education (as education for community) in a robust and coherent way. The closest UK texts are Informal Education (Jeffs and Smith 1996) which is really an introductory exploration, Lovett et al (1983) which focuses on adult education and popular social movements, and Local Education (Smith 1994) - which looks to localness. Brookfield (1983) is strong on 'education in the community' and McConnell (1996) provides with a diverse but useful collection of key documents in the making of Scottish community education. Bidwell and McConnell (1982) is an edited collection that hails from an earlier period of Scottish community education The two collections by Poster and Krüger (1990) and Poster and Zimmer (1992) contain some useful explorations of practice and one or two helpful discussions of the idea of community education (see, in particular, Cyril Poster's chapter in Poster and Krüger 1990). Most of the other texts with community education in their title are rather school-centred (for details see the <a id = "http" href = "http://Schooling/b-comsch.html">Community Schooling</a> listing. I have included Lindeman (1926) and Yeaxlee (1929) because of their strong concerns with education for democracy and local forms of practice.</p>

<p>In numerous polls and surveys, Americans identify education as one of the leading domestic challenges of the twenty-first century. Specifically, the challenge is not just to reform public schools but also to achieve the goal of academic success for all students. Many educational experts agree that reaching that goal will require increased cooperation among the schools themselves and a new kind of collaboration with the families and communities served by the schools.</p>

<p>Community education offers a structured, effective way to respond to the challenge to improve public education because it expands the school's traditional role and creates a mutually interdependent relationship among home, school, and community. Community education has three basic components - lifelong learning opportunities, community involvement in schools, and efficient use of resources - and is based on a set of ten broad principles:</p>

<p><i>Lifelong learning</i>. Education is a birth-to-death process, and everyone in the community shares in the responsibility of educating all members of the community. Formal and informal learning opportunities should be available to residents of all ages in a wide variety of community settings.</p>
<p><i>Self-determination</i>. Community residents have a right and a responsibility to be involved in assessing community needs and identifying community resources that can be used to address those needs.</p>
<p><i>Self-help</i>. People are best served by their leaders when their capacity to help themselves is acknowledged and developed. When people assume responsibility for their own well-being, they achieve some degree of independence.</p>
<p><i>Leadership development</i>. Training local leaders in problem solving, decision-making, and group-process skills is essential to community improvement efforts.
<p><i>Institutional responsiveness</i>. Because public institutions exist to serve the public, they are obligated to develop programs and services that address constantly changing public needs and interests.</p>
<p><i>Integrated delivery of services</i>. Organizations and agencies that operate for the public good can best use their limited resources, meet their own goals, and serve the public by collaborating with organizations and agencies with similar goals and purposes.</p>
Localization. Community services, programs, and volunteer opportunities close to people's homes have the greatest potential for high levels of public participation.
<p><i>Maximum use of resources</i>. The physical, financial, and human resources of every community should be fully available and rationally interconnected if the diverse needs and interests of the community are to be met.</p>
<p><i>Inclusiveness</i>. Community programs, activities, and services should involve the broadest possible cross-section of community residents without segregation by age, income, sex, race, ethnicity, religion, or other characteristics.</p>
<p><i>Access to public information</i>. Public information should be shared across agency and organization lines because an effective community not only has "the facts," but it also knows what those facts mean in the lives of the diverse people who make up the community.</p>

<p id = "tit"><b>A Comprehensive Plan</b></p>

<p>The current lack of confidence in public education has been more <a id = "href" href = "http://www.answers.com/topic/pervasive">pervasive</a> and prolonged than the crisis in confidence that followed the launch of <i>Sputnik</i> in 1957 by the Soviet Union. Community education has become the approach of choice of many educators who are determined to improve the public confidence in schools and to build partnerships in support of public education.</p>

<p>Community education is a way of looking at public education as a total community enterprise. A community education program is a comprehensive and coordinated plan for providing educational, recreational, social, and cultural services for all people in the community. The following strategies provide a framework for developing such a program. The strategies have overlapping characteristics and functions, but taken together, they outline a comprehensive action plan.</p>

<p><b>Strategy 1. Encourage increased use of community resources and volunteers to augment the basic educational program.</b>Every community has human, physical, and financial resources that can be used to <a id = "href" href = "http://www.answers.com/topic/enrich">enrich</a> and expand traditional education programs. Community resources and volunteers have been used to expand curricular options, conduct field and study trips, offer various kinds of tutoring, sponsor student-based enterprises, and support experiential learning.</p>

<p><b>Strategy 2. Develop educational partnerships between schools and public and private service providers, business and industry, and civic and social service organizations.</b> Complex, often interrelated, social and economic problems create a broad array of service needs in many communities, and meeting them effectively is likely to require more resources than any single agency or organization can provide. The development of partnerships for cooperative use of available resources will help prevent unnecessary duplication in the delivery of such services as child care, after-school programs, drug education and treatment, literacy and <a id = "href" href = "http://www.answers.com/topic/remedial">remedial</a> programs, internships and work-study programs, and career awareness activities.</p>

<p><b>Strategy 3. Use public education facilities as community service centers for meeting the educational, social, health, cultural, and recreational needs of all ages and sectors of the community.</b> Since community attitudes and support affect the schools' ability to carry out their mission to educate all children, educators must consider the needs and concerns of nonparents in the community. This strategy encourages keeping school buildings open on a planned, organized basis at hours beyond the regular school day. It takes advantage of the strong support community centers generally receive, as well as the economic benefits to the community of more efficient use of public facilities.</p>

<p><b>Strategy 4. Develop an environment that fosters lifelong learning.</b> This strategy acknowledges learning as a lifelong process. It recognizes that learning takes place, both inside and outside the school setting, without formal instruction. It encourages the development of education programs to meet learning needs that change over a lifetime, including the need for new skills and knowledge. Lifelong learning programs and activities may include early childhood education, extended-day and enrichment programs for school-age children, adult education, vocational training and retraining programs, leisure activities, and intergenerational programs.</p>

<p><b>Strategy 5. Establish a process for involving the community in educational planning and decisionmaking.</b> The total community has a stake in the mission of educating community members. Individual community members, therefore, have a right and a responsibility to participate in determining community needs, setting priorities, and allocating resources. The cyclical process of planning, evaluating, and changing takes advantage of a basic fact of human behavior: Those who participate in planning and decision-making develop feelings of ownership. Encouraging the broadest possible involvement capitalizes on another fact: The greater the number and diversity of people involved, the greater the <a id = "href" href = "http://www.answers.com/topic/likelihood">likelihood</a> that diverse needs will be met. Involvement opportunities should range from participation in ongoing advisory councils to membership on <a id = "href" href = "http://www.answers.com/topic/ad-hoc">ad hoc</a> task forces and committees.</p>

<p><b>Strategy 6. Provide a responsive, community based system for collective action by all educational and community agencies to address community issues.</b> Many community problems are so complex that resolving them requires cooperative use of a broad range of resources. Seeking the involvement of nonschool agencies can help schools address such social, health, and economic issues as substance abuse, housing, child abuse, mental illness, violence, crime, vandalism, teen pregnancy, and various kinds of discrimination.</p>

<p><b>Strategy 7. Develop a system that facilitates home-school-community communication.</b> Research shows that schools that involve all their publics and keep them well informed have community support, and that those that fail to reach beyond the parents of current students do not. Effective home-school-community communication goes beyond news releases, speeches, newsletters, and open houses; it includes use of the media, home visitations by teachers and administrators, school displays throughout the community, and special community outreach programs conducted both in the schools and at other sites in the community.</p>

<p id = "tit"><b>Community School</b></p>

<p>The term <i>community school</i> designates a school site where the concept of community education is put into practice. Community education may also be implemented in community agencies and organizations, but the most common site is a public school.</p>

<p>A community school departs from a traditional public school's schedule and curriculum. A community school is open year-round, eighteen hours or more a day, often seven days a week. The school thus becomes not just a place to teach children but a community learning center with multiple uses.</p>

<p>In a community school, the concept of public education is extended beyond the traditional K - 12 program to include the provision of learning opportunities for the entire community. The traditional schedule is expanded through extended day programs (including before- and after-school activities and care), and recreational, social, and educational programs for community residents of all ages. Activities and programs may not be limited to the school building, itself, as the school extends itself into the community, turning agencies, factories, businesses, and the surrounding environment into learning laboratories.</p>

<p>By organizing programs and activities that serve all ages and populations, a community school encourages <a id = "href" href = "http://www.answers.com/topic/disparate">disparate</a> elements of the community to come together to work toward common goals. It provides a physical setting as well as an organizational structure for school-community collaboration.</p>

<p id = "tit"><b>Impact on Education and Communities</b></p>

<p>Because many community problems ultimately affect a community's ability to educate all children, educators in some communities are taking a leadership role in the search for solutions to community problems. From a problem-solving point of view, a community school can be a support center for a network of agencies and institutions committed to addressing broad community needs. Using schools as community centers is a cost-effective, practical way to use one of the community's largest investments - its school buildings. The community school reaches out to the community and works as a cooperative partner to address community needs, including educational needs.</p>

<p>The possible benefits to schools and communities from a well-designed and carefully implemented community education program have been described in a variety of studies, including the U.S. Department of Education's <i>Strong Families, Strong Schools</i> (1994) and Safe and Smart, from the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice (1998). Documented improvements include a better school learning climate, reduced violence and vandalism, more efficient energy use, increased family involvement, and broadened community-wide educational opportunities. Other studies show improved institutional responsiveness to the needs of parents and community members and increased public support for schools and other public agencies.</p>

<p id = "tit"><b>Community Education in Action</b></p>

<p>Community education takes advantage of local resources and capabilities and responds to an individual community's particular needs and wishes. Just as no two communities have exactly the same program, no community retains exactly the same program over a period of years. As a community matures, its institutions, population, assets, and problems change, and its community education program must be modified to reflect those changes if it is to remain successful.</p>

<p>Because every community education program is designed to reflect the current needs of a specific community and the resources available to meet those needs, there are literally hundreds of models of programs. The website of the National Center for Community Education has descriptions of <a id = "href" href = "http://www.answers.com/topic/exemplary">exemplary</a> models and case studies of community education programs in three model settings - school, district, or agency. The website of the Coalition for Community Schools profiles nine community schools (four elementary, two middle, two high schools, and one <a id = "href" href = "http://www.answers.com/topic/preschool">preschool</a>).</p>

    <p><h2>Economic Crisis Program and Homeless Program</h2>

<p>An economic crisis can happen to any one of us. People who experience financial emergencies in their lives are experiencing economic crisis. People in our community face emergencies each day without needed resources of support, food, and shelter. A person may find him or herself in this predicament due to job loss, increase in rent payments, medical emergency, car repairs, or other financial responsibilities. When a person is set back by any or all the above experiences, he or she can contact the Community Crisis Center for emergency and financial assistance.</p>

<p><strong>The Economic Crisis Program at the Community Crisis Center is addressing the needs of those in the community who have basic needs of food, clothing, and safe shelter. More and more people in the community come in requesting these services, as they are not able to financially support themselves and their families. They may be homeless, unemployed, very low income, or experiencing greater expenses whereby their usual adequate income, cannot meet their needs. Affordable housing and fair wages are issues that are real in our economy and affect a person’s ability to survive economically in society.</strong></p>

<p>There are many causes of homelessness:</p>

<p>In Illinois, as well as other states, there are not as many mental health organizations that provide housing to those experiencing mental illness. Therefore, more and more of those who find themselves living on the street have mental health needs that are not being met.
When low-income neighborhoods are converted to new housing, the new housing may become unaffordable to those who previously could afford the once existing housing. Safe, secure, and affordable housing for the poor is at a minimum in our area as well as others, whereby, people either experience homelessness or economic crisis.
Some veterans also experience difficulty in assimilating back into society after serving our country.
Some people have difficulty getting back on their feet after they have experience a fire, or a natural disaster such as a flood in their home.
People who have some kind of criminal background also find it very difficult to find employment which then causes them either to become homeless, or experience economic crisis.
Women, who are raising their children, on their own, have difficulty making ends meet. It may be due to little or no child support, difficulty finding affordable child care, or any other financial difficulty that they may experience. They may find themselves in need of shelter or emergency/financial assistance due to their financial predicaments.</p>

<h2 id = "TT">HELP IS AVAILABLE AT THE COMMUNITY CRISIS CENTER, 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK</h2> 
================================================================================================================================================

<p><strong><h1>Population</h1></strong></p> 
  
<p>A <b>population</b> is the <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Number" title = "Number">number</a> of living things that live together in the same place. A <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/City" title = "City">city's</a> population is the number of people living in that city. These people are called <b>inhabitants</b> or <b>residents</b>. The population includes all individuals that live in that certain area.
<a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Population_density" title = "Population density">Population density</a> is the <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Average" title = "Average">average</a> number of people in a place. In areas with a high population density, people live close to each other, such as in a big city. In areas with a low population density, people usually live far away from each other, such as in <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Rural" title = "Rural">rural</a> areas out in the countryside.
Usually population is about the number of animals or humans there are in a certain area. The <a id = "http" href = "http://w/index.php" title = "Maximum (not yet started)">maximum</a> population that can be supported in an area is called the <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Carrying_capacity" title = "Carrying capacity">carrying capacity</a>.</p>

<p><strong><h1>Population trends</h1></strong></p>

<p>The world population reached seven billion people in 2011. Global population is going up, but the population growth rate is declining all over the world. Currently India has 32 cities with populations above one million. Increasing population leads to higher <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Health_care" title = "Health care">health care</a> expenditures.</p>

<p><strong><h1>Statistical population</h1></strong></p>

<p>A statistical population is a set of entities concerning which <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Statistical_inference" title = "Statistical inference">statistical inferences</a> are to be drawn, often based on a <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Random_sample" title = "Random sample">random sample</a> taken from the population. For example, if we were interested in generalizations about <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Crows" title = "Crows" >crows</a>, then we would describe the set of crows that is of interest. Notice that if we choose a population like all crows, we will be limited to observing crows that exist now or will exist in the future. In addition, <a id = "href" href = "/http:/wiki/Geography" title = "Geography">geography</a> will also constitute a limitation in that our resources for studying crows are also limited.</p>

<p>The term statistical population is also used to refer to a set of potential <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Measurement" title = "Measurement">measurements</a> or values, including not only cases actually observed but those that are potentially <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Observable" title = "Observable">observable</a>. Suppose, for example, we are interested in the set of all adult crows now alive in the island of <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Ambergris_Caye" title = "Ambergris Caye">Ambergris Caye</a>, and we want to know the mean weight of these birds. For each bird in the population of crows there is a weight, and the set of these weights is called the population of weights.</p>

<p><strong><h1>Subpopulation</h1></strong></p>

<p>A <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Subset" title = "Subset">subset</a> of a population is called a <b>subpopulation</b>. If different subpopulations have different properties, so the overall population is <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Heterogeneous" title = "Heterogeneous">heterogeneous</a>, the properties and response of the overall population can often be better understood if it is first separated into distinct subpopulations. For instance, a particular medicine may have different effects on different subpopulations, and these effects may be obscured or dismissed if such special subpopulations are not identified and examined in isolation.
Similarly, one can often estimate parameters more accurately if one separates out subpopulations: the distribution of heights among people is better modeled by considering men and women as separate subpopulations, for instance.</p>
<p>Populations consisting of subpopulations can be modeled by <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Mixture_model" title = "Mixture model">mixture models</a>, which combine the distributions within subpopulations into an overall population distribution. Even if subpopulations are well-modeled by given simple models, the overall population may be poorly fit by a given simple model – poor fit may be evidence for existence of subpopulations. For example, given two equal subpopulations, both normally distributed, if they have the same standard deviation and different means, the overall distribution will exhibit low <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Kurtosis" title = "Kurtosis">kurtosis</a> relative to a single normal distribution – the means of the subpopulations fall on the shoulders of the overall distribution. If sufficiently separated, these form a <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Bimodal_distribution" title = "Bimodal distribution">bimodal distribution</a>, otherwise it simply has a wide peak. Further, it will exhibit <a id = "href" href = "http://wiki/Overdispersion" title = "Overdispersion">overdispersion</a> relative to a single normal distribution with the given variation. Alternatively, given two subpopulations with the same mean and different standard deviations, the overall population will exhibit high kurtosis, with a sharper peak and heavier tails (and correspondingly shallower shoulders) than a single distribution.</p>
